# What is Makeathon?
Makeathon is a 36-hour long competition where students collaborate within interdisciplinary teams to design and create innovative projects. In the past, participants have created anything from Alexa integration with DoubleMap, an automatic sandwich maker, and even a miniature greenhouse. With the help of our sponsors, we are able to provide students with a platform to innovate and give life to their ideas. During the competition, participants will have access to materials, machinery, as well as the opportunity to learn from industry-leading companies.
